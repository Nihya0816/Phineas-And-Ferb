        <p>Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother, Ferb Fletcher, are determined to make every day of their summer vacation
            fun. They try building a full-scale roller coaster, becoming musicians, building a backyard beach, and
            traveling back in time to meet dinosaurs. Their family pet, Perry the Platypus, doubles as a secret agent
            and battles evil. Meanwhile, older sister Candace is tattling on them to Mom and Dad, though she can never
            seem to catch them in the act.</p>
